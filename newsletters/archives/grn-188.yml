    "#### Observability and Digestibility


This is a word I love. I found it again in a [recent blog post about system blindness][blindness] and it reminded me how critical this need is. Our systems get more and more numerous and small. The reliability and debugging of a platform now goes into various loops given the multiplication of actors. 


Observability should be one core pre-requisite when designing a service oriented architecture with micro-services. But just having everything plugged to some ELK is not going to help that much. I feel that there is a new job in there. Some function that has to be fulfilled. Something to reduce that vast amount of data into something that makes sense. An intermediary that will correlate logs from various sources. It would put them together and reduce them to some meaningful 'events'.


So I think observability is not enough. Digestibility is what makes observability worth it. Maybe such tools already exist? Hmm, probably in the containers worlds there is something like that. Is there not?
