    "#### Someone's birthday


I've heard that today is someone's birthday, and it seems a cake and \"Happpy birthday\" is not enough, people are throwing parties with reds and greens all over the place.


I've also heard that the night before his birthday, an old stranger with red shirt will break into houses with kids inside while they are sleeping, but the weird thing is that no one really call the police...


Let's hope trees got decorated can survive till next year, and every child gets more parents' love than what they got from a red stranger.

=========================

Recently I read [this][checklist] article, it is a checklist about how to keep your front-end sane in 2017. The amount of new techniques to keep track of is just astonishing.


I think many people will feel the same, how is there consistantly so many new libraries and tools for doing front-end.


Perhaps if there was some kind of standard or versioning like css3 html5. Such that browser maker and app makers can conform to. To produce best performance apps for each iteration.


This will probably resolve broswer fragmentation and the myriad of libraries/techniques we have to deal with.


That'd be a real Merry Christmas!
