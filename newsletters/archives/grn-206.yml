    "#### Imagination

    I am not a believer of many things, like god, fate, or fortune teller, but I am a believer of imagination. It's the motivation for human to make great things based on something only in their head.


    Sometimes we mistakenly treat illusion as imagination, which leads to (or will leed to) disasters. To distinguish them is actually easy, for imagination you can foresee real steps to the destination, but illusion only shows the destination itself without any routes to it.


    More precisely, when we moving toward an imagination, it becomes a vision, a goal, or an open source project. Do you have any imaginations? Let's make it happen today!
