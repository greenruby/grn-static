    "#### Get out


If you only ever have lived in only one country, you really should consider fixing it. Going [live in another country][1] for some years or more is just such a way towards a richer life. It's usually easy to recognize people that are multi-rooted, as they often have an increased depth in their personal philosophy.


We are lucky, in our craft, to have various opportunities to travel and work remotely, or for foreign companies. Many of you are already aware of those benefits. But to the others I can just say this: use this opportunity! Get out!
