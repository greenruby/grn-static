    "#### The art of learning


In my review this week I read that [Old Geek post][oldgeek], which has a lot of comments under its feet. This is quite interesting. But I feel there is a confusion here.


From my experience, age is often related to stagnation. The more you accumulate, the heavier you are. It's heart-breaking to abandon years of investment in one type of knowledge. Therefore, generally speaking, older people are less flexible and less likely to surf on the waves of the new technologies.


But I can tell you as a fact that this is just a natural human law, that, like many others, can be bended. Bended by discipline, the same way we overcome our animal instincts. There are many old practitioners of our skill that became master in the art of change. The sacred art of eternal learning. The wisdom of daily questioning of previously acquired knowledge.


Obsolescence is not a question of age, but just a question of personality, environment and priorities. I know a handful of such oldgeeks that didn't yet reach their 30's. And personally (in my 49), I won't stop surfing any time soon. hahaha.
