The end

GreenRuby weekly newsletter ceases to exist.
No more email will be sent.
No more update will be made.

After 4 years of relentless gathering of links, we have to come to this 
painful decision to quit. Few months ago, I got distracted, and Xenor 
stepped up to manage the publication. But now he's in a transition too 
and it's time for us to take a decision.

It's been a blast. Thank you all for your support. And special thanks to 
Xenor and Tysliu, without their active involvement this newsletter may have 
died 2 years ago. Now let's move on. There is going to be more adventures 
down the road.

After this email is sent, the whole list of subscribers will be deleted, 
so we won't have any ways to reach you anymore. Feel free to reach us at 
news@greenruby.org

You can still reach the archives of the past newsletters on http://greenruby.org
