Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by xenor.

#### Imagination
I am not a believer of many things, like god, fate, or fortune teller, but I
am a believer of imagination. It's the motivation for human to make great
things based on something only in their head.

Sometimes we mistakenly treat illusion as imagination, which leads to (or will
leed to) disasters. To distinguish them is actually easy, for imagination you
can foresee real steps to the destination, but illusion only shows the
destination itself without any routes to it.

More precisely, when we moving toward an imagination, it becomes a vision, a
goal, or an open source project. Do you have any imaginations? Let's make it
happen today!
