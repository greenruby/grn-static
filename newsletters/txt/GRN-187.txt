Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### Get out

If you only ever have lived in only one country, you really should consider
fixing it. Going [live in another country][1] for some years or more is just
such a way towards a richer life. It's usually easy to recognize people that
are multi-rooted, as they often have an increased depth in their personal
philosophy.

We are lucky, in our craft, to have various opportunities to travel and work
remotely, or for foreign companies. Many of you are already aware of those
benefits. But to the others I can just say this: use this opportunity! Get
out!
