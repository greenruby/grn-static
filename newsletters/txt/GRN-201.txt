Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by xenor.

#### Machine Learning
After AlphaGo beats human, it seems more and more programmers and programming
languages start to put their hands into the secret hole. I am not there yet,
but the trend is really forcing us to face it.

I believe soon enough we will either be programmed by program or write the
program to program others. When the time comes, which side will you stand?
