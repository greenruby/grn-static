Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by xenor.

#### Meaning of death
Recently I've lost 3 family members in 5 years, accident, age, and sickness.
One night, my 5 years old son asked me: "Where are we going after death? How
does it feel like?" Here are my answers: "You are not going anywhere, and it
feels like void."

Death means blood stop moving, and brain stops working, what's after are all
imaginations or willings from others instead of the dead. From heaven to hell,
from funeral to tomb, everything is to comfort or satisfy the livings, no
matter which religion or belief.

Do not spend time on things that's already ended, move on and have your last
days worth living.
