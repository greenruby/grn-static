Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### Observability and Digestibility

This is a word I love. I found it again in a [recent blog post about system
blindness][blindness] and it reminded me how critical this need is. Our
systems get more and more numerous and small. The reliability and debugging of
a platform now goes into various loops given the multiplication of actors.

Observability should be one core pre-requisite when designing a service
oriented architecture with micro-services. But just having everything plugged
to some ELK is not going to help that much. I feel that there is a new job in
there. Some function that has to be fulfilled. Something to reduce that vast
amount of data into something that makes sense. An intermediary that will
correlate logs from various sources. It would put them together and reduce
them to some meaningful 'events'.

So I think observability is not enough. Digestibility is what makes
observability worth it. Maybe such tools already exist? Hmm, probably in the
containers worlds there is something like that. Is there not?
