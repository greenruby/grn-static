Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### The art of learning

In my review this week I read that [Old Geek post][oldgeek], which has a lot
of comments under its feet. This is quite interesting. But I feel there is a
confusion here.

From my experience, age is often related to stagnation. The more you
accumulate, the heavier you are. It's heart-breaking to abandon years of
investment in one type of knowledge. Therefore, generally speaking, older
people are less flexible and less likely to surf on the waves of the new
technologies.

But I can tell you as a fact that this is just a natural human law, that, like
many others, can be bended. Bended by discipline, the same way we overcome our
animal instincts. There are many old practitioners of our skill that became
master in the art of change. The sacred art of eternal learning. The wisdom of
daily questioning of previously acquired knowledge.

Obsolescence is not a question of age, but just a question of personality,
environment and priorities. I know a handful of such oldgeeks that didn't yet
reach their 30's. And personally (in my 49), I won't stop surfing any time
soon. hahaha.
