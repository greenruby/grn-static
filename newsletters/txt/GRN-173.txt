Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### GreenRuby IRL and Remote meetup

Last week I posted a link about [Remote Meetups][rm], but, as it sometimes
happens, it didn't stop there. The basic principle was appealing to me. It's
true that we don't all live in the Bay area or in New York. Having high
quality speakers in meetups is hard when you live in a small city or a remote
country. And this is exactly what that initiative tries to address.

So I jumped in and had some talk with Franze. The result is that the GreenRuby
meetup we will have this friday will also be remote. Some people will [attend
physically][grg001], some people will [come virtually][grm001] using the
[Bigmarker][bm] platform on the RemoteMeetup account.

Those events usually are based on a format including a presentation followed
by interactions. My plan is to go nuts and try a full-social format, with no
presentation at all, jumping directly to the interactions. It's going to be
highly experimental and may lead to failure, but it certainly won't kill any
kitten in the process so I think we are safe.

The mix between physical and remote event is the challenging part. We may try
the [usage of mobile phones][mobile] to make local people become remote
participants (but it seems to be IOs only for now). I will get an iPad ready
for easier floating access, that can be fun.

You are welcome to join, either online or irl. I heard [Gandi][gn], the
physical host and my employer, is going to fill up the fridge with hundred of
various beverages and won't mind us to help reduce that quantity.
