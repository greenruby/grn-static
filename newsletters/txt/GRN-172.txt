Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by xenor and mose.

#### Chrome non-published extensions

I've made a small chrome extension to help myself abstract information for
articles a year ago: [Squeezer][squeezer]

But recently after upgrade to version 50, chrome puts more restriction on
local unpacked extension which makes install and enable it like hell: [Chrome
50 disabled non-published extensions, and they cannot be
re-enabled!][chromeforum]

This actually upsets me, especially because of the reason: "For obvious
reasons though, it's not good to encourage users to load unpacked extensions,
as I'm sure you'll understand.". No, I don't understand!

For companies (or even countries), there is always a reason to restricts
something and claims they are protecting their users/citizens from danger,
which to me is totally bullshit. If you are using or doing something, you
should be responsible to know what you get yourself into, it's never others
fault to put you into such situation like having malicious malware in your
laptop. It's all about choices.

And by choices we made freely, it's not fair for a super power (or anyone) to
just cut choices out because of someone did something that hurts themselves.
It should just be like open sourced software, shouldn't it? If we choose to
use an open-source software, and it bites us back because of whatever reason,
does the owner just close the project or we file an issue/PR to fix it? I am
pretty sure the answer is the later.

Stop using protection as the excuse to make people having less freedom or put
freedom to a price ($5 to put your chrome extension to Web Store so that you
can enable your small self-made nobody wants to use extension).

#### First GreenRuby Meetup

Recently Gandi moved to a much bigger office in Neihu, Taipei. And I got
permission to use the space to organize events. We got a great space, sound
system with wireless mikes, a beamer for presentations. So, if you are in
Taipei, feel free to [join us on wednesday next week][grg001].  I will try to
make it a remote meetup, and give more details next week.
