Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### nothing to report

Yeah there are weeks like that, I don't have inspiration. Or I'm lazy. Or I'm
too busy writing [javascript tests][tests] with mocha, chai and or sinon.
Already having 3 times more lines of code in tests that in code and even if
coverage says 80% I know for a fact that there are many more cases I need to
test. Anyways, there is too much fun for me to just go beyond the traditional
gathering of the links for this week. Can't write a rant. No way.
