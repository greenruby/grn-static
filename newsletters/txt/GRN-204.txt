Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by xenor.

#### 2017
There is nothing wrong to wish a better year and review what's been done last
year, but when it's everywhere in social media, I started to ask myself, what
are all those wishes and reviews for? Is it something people really wants to
share or something to get others' attention on? I've been wondering the word
"share" in social media for a long time.

In developers world, you share your work as open source and other devs can
come and help or gets help by using it, but what can we get form others' share
in social media? Happiness or sense of loss caused by other's happiness?
Useful information or bias information looks useful because of a lot of
likes/retweets?

I am probably cynical and you don't have to be like that. It's a brand new
year and wish we all get something different this year :)
