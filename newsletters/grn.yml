<h4>GreenRuby weekly newsletter ceases to exist.<br>
No more email will be sent.<br>
No more update will be made.</h4>

<p><br></p>

<p>After 4 years of relentless gathering of links, we have to come to this painful decision to 
quit. Few months ago, I got distracted, and Xenor stepped up to manage the publication.
But now he's in a transition too and it's time for us to take a decision.</p>

<p>It's been a blast. Thank you all for your support. And special thanks to Xenor and Tysliu, 
without their active involvement this newsletter may have died 2 years ago. Now let's move on. 
There is going to be more adventures down the road.</p>

<p>After this email is sent, the whole list of subscribers will be deleted, so we 
won't have any ways to reach you anymore. Feel free to reach us at news@greenruby.org</p>

<p>You can still reach the archives of the past newsletters on <a href=\"http://greenruby.org\">http://greenruby.org</a></p>
