    "#### The end


tl;dr - GreenRuby weekly newsletter ceases to exist. No more email will be sent.


After 4 years for gathering of links, we have to come to this painful decision to 
quit. Few months ago, I got distracted, and Xenor stepped up to manage the publication.
But now he's in a transition too and it's time for us to take a decision.


It's been a blast. Thank you all for your support. Now let's move on. 
There is going to be more adventures down the road. 


After this email is sent, the whole list of subscribers will be deleted, so we 
won't have any ways to reach you anymore. Feel free to reach us at news@greenruby.org
