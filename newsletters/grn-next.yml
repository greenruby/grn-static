Recently I read [this][checklist] article, it is a checklist about how to keep your front-end sane in 2017. The amount of new techniques to keep track of is just astounishing.


I think many people will feel the same, how is there consistantly so many new libraries and tools for doing front-end.


Perhaps if there was some kind of standard or versioning like css3 html5. Such that browser maker and app makers can conform to. To produce best performance apps for each iteration.


This will probably resolve broswer fragmentation and the myriad of libraries/techniques we have to deal with.


That'd be a real Merry Christmas!
