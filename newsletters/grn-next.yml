    "#### Merry Christmas And Happy New Year 2017


It is the season of giving and forgiving this time around.


We often reflect upon ourselves, on what we did good or bad during the year. This is a good practice, perhaps this should be done more often.


I'm thankful for all the friends and relations that I've made, and to work with a team that pushes my boundaries for growth and learning.


One thing I can still improve on is to just write the solution as soon as there is an idea. This way I can know as soon as it doesn't work and also save my time on questioning if is possible.


I hope next year will be even better and Happy Holidays!
