On a brighter side, I also went to <a href=\"http://eventifier.com/event/railspacific14/popular\">rails pacific</a> yesterday, it was nice to meet some Green Ruby subscribers there.",null],[87,"oct 5th 2014","As there is a lot of new subscribers this week, let me remind you what this newsletter is.<br>I'm a french fullstack <a href=\"http://mose.com\">geek</a> living in Taiwan, ruby lover, and currently in a devops phase. I don't have much time to surf around during the week as I have a fulltime job. So every Sunday I dedicate 4 to 6 hours to sort my inbox, check stuff, track what's new, so I can remain current. <br>And then as I'm doing it for myself, well, I structured it a bit and sent my review to some friends. <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com\">Mailchimp</a> offers a free tier, the review is done already, why not share it to a wider audience. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tubaxenor\">Xenor</a> sends me some links every week, as well as various other people now. Having more people reading it and appreciating this review helps me to stay motivated doing it every week. So, thanks for that.",null],[88,"oct 12th 2014","If you understand japanese, check the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLJvdMIoJs4\">presentation</a> of tenderlove at rubykaigi.

The consequence is that I'm flying to Paris next week for one month. I wonder if I will be able to feed up Greenruby links curation as regularly as usual. That may be challenging. In the while, check out the <a href=\"http://railsrumble.com/entries/winners\">Rails Rumble Winners</a> for this year, there is some cool things.",null],[92,"nov 9th 2014","My new job is much deeper in devops than before. Gandi really is a great environment for real geeks. Rails and ruby still remains dear to my heart, but now this becomes a side interest for me. I hope I still can keep up with this weekly gathering of links. Some focus may change though. I'm switching now from chef to puppet, and I may have even more interest on devops links. But I will try to keep it balanced. Maybe organize the links gathering a little more collaboratively?",null],[93,"nov 16th 2014","This newsletter is sent from Marseille, gonna catch a train back to Paris now.",null],[94,"nov 23th 2014","I'm still on the move, this weekend at Rennes.",null],[95,"nov 30th 2014","This is a quick edition.

But I'll be back to Taiwan next week.",null],[97,"dec 14th 2014","Back to Taipei, after a one-month trip to Paris in the Headquarters of <a href=\"http://gandi.net\">Gandi</a>. My new devops job is amazing, the team is hardcore and the culture really refreshing.
