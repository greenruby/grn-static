# About Green Ruby

## Genesis

The Newsletter began in june 2012 from the habit I had to
send weekly newsletter in [Codegreen][1] for our team to know what is
happenning in our company. That was purely a teamwork tool for general
transparency. But with time passing I also included there some links to
what I was finding around that would be of interest for my geek colleagues.

That CodeGreen Internal newsletter began to be cluttered with various links
at the bottom of it. So I decided to separate that links gathering bunch in
another newsletter. But then it could also be useful for my friends, out of
the scope of our team.

At that time I had to test [Mailchimp][2] service for one of our projects,
so because they offer a free package when volume is not too big, I thought
I should just create that newsletter as a public freeely available publication.

So in february 2013 I sent the first Green Ruby Newsletter to 3 subscribers. Well,
mostly our team :) Then it became a weekly habit, so I got a domain name for it,
and organicaly it's growing slowly.

## The publication process

Now that it became a well rounded habit, the process stabilised in an efficient routine.

At first I have been using a lot of rss readers, first Google reader, then they closed,
I used [Newsblur][3] and then [Feedspot][4], [Prismatic][10] and [Reddit][12].
I also extended my list of podcasts with [Gpodder][5] and I gathered a bunch of [links][9]
that I check weekly.

So each week, I listen to various podcasts during my 50 min commute twice a day, when I catch
something in my daily work I got tweet it on [@greenrubist][16] using a [Buffer][11] free account
(but really those people rock, one day I will pay for it).

And on sunday, [William][14] (aka xenor) also sends me a list of links. Simon began to send links 
as well, starting in autumn 2014. In the evening I begin to
build the yaml file that I use for generating the letter and the website. I spend between 4 and 6 hours,
reading around, checking what's up, and so on. Very often it's 3am when I'm done and then I send the
letter manually from Mailchimp.

## After 2 years

Two years passed. Not one week came without its pubication. It became a sunday routine for me,
with various benifits for myself and my friends. Few people subscribed each week from the website.

There have been various attempts to automate the publication tool, using ember, or other toys.
But the most reliable toolset ended up being a couple of rake tasks for producing the mailchimp
template and the website content. Some hope can be preserved about the evolution of the platform,
but I have been busy quite a bunch, changing job, as well as xenor, that helped me with some links
each weeks.

The non-commercial aspect of this media is stronger than ever. It's actually too small scale to
have any cost. Mailchimp still is free for less than 2000 subscribers.
